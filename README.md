# Motor-Cooling-System-Design
.Our solution to the problem statement involves 2 approaches. 

On opening the ZIP file of our submission, one can find 4 files, One REAMDE text file, PDF file of our report and 2 FOLDERS

The files corresponding to each approach has been included in a separate folder namely, 
1)MotorCoolingSystem_Approach1
2)MotorCoolingSystem_Approach2

On opening each folder you can find the following files for each approach,

1) The drive cycle data(A Microsoft excel file)

2) The Simulink model for that approach.(This is the .slx file which needs to be opened to see our model )

3) A system generated Simulink cache file 

4) A video showing the temperature profile of the motor over time. This video shows that the motor temperature saturates well below 45degrees within the given drive cycle period.

5) A matlab file consisting of parameter values for various components of the simulink model. 
This file needs to be run to get the variables into the workspace before the user wishes to run the simulink model
